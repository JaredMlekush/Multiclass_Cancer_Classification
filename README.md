# Multiclass_Optuna_StratifiedKfold_LightGBM
Performed in depth analysis of data that describes miRNA features with a target cancer stage. Followed with EDA steps to decide how to structure our model. After doing the necessary analyses, implemented XGBoost and LightGBM, which perform particularly well on tabular data. Afterwards, Optuna framework was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model. Then presented the associated results for both the base model and hyperparameter optimized model.
